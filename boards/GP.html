                <p>
                    In this project, I was tasked with creating a game of my liking while using strategies that I had learned so far in the semester,
                    The main focus of this game was the use of arrays, I would get objects, display information, save them in arrays, and spawn based on an input array. 
                    I also took advantage of Unreal's feature of components, similar to how Unity works, you create a component and attach it to the object.
                    One thing that I improved on later on was the use of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singelton Pattern</a>.
                    Because this game was made in unreal it can be exported for others to play easily on the web or PC, however, this game is not finished, once completed a download will be available.
